# Helium Documentation

These pages will contain documentation for the Helium pedigree visualization software developed by Information and Computational Sciences at the James Hutton Institute in Scotland.

Please either click on the 'Wiki' link above or [here](https://github.com/cardinalb/helium-docs/wiki) to go to the documentation. These documents are very much a work in progress so if there are any questions you may have on Helium then please contact us on [helium@hutton.ac.uk](mailto:helium@hutton.ac.uk). Also, any feedback on how we can improve Helium or add new features that would be useful to the community please let us know.
